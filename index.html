              in the ninth century, when a goat herder noticed the beverage's
              stimulating properties. It became a beloved beverage all over the
              world as it expanded throughout the Arab world and beyond.

                <b class="coffee">Coffee beans</b>, or the seeds of the Coffea
                plant, are roasted and used to make the popular beverage coffee.
                Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta are the two most widely
                utilized and significant species in terms of commerce. Coffee is
                usually made by grinding the roasted beans and then brewing them
                in hot water to release their scents and flavors. People from
                all across the world have long liked coffee. Caffeine, a
                naturally occurring stimulant, can help boost attention and
                lessen weariness. Numerous variables, including the kind of
                beans used, the degree of roasting, and the brewing technique,
                can affect how coffee tastes.
